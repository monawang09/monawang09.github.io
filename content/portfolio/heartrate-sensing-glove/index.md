The Heart Rate Sensing Glove is an innovative wearable designed to monitor the heart health of seniors in real-time. This glove is equipped with  sensors  and led lights continuously track the user's pulse and display the heart rate on an integrated real-time screen for instant feedback.

To ensure safety and timely intervention, the glove is programmed to detect irregularities in heart rate, such as abnormalities or sudden drops. When such issues are identified, the device sends automatic alerts to caregivers or emergency contacts via a connected system, ensuring prompt attention.
