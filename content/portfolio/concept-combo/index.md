# abstract: To systematically investigate evasive bots, we deploy a honey site incorporating two anti-bot services (DataDome and BotD) and solicit bot traffic from 20 different bot services that purport to sell “realistic and undetectable traffic.” Across half a million requests from 20 different bot services on our honey site, we find an average evasion rate of 52.93% against DataDome and 44.56% evasion rate against BotD.

As access to educational video resources has been enhanced through search tools, recommender systems, and social channeling, users often encounter challenges in integrating diverse videos systematically, particularly when they possess a limited understanding of the topics at hand (e.g., novice learners). To address this challenge, we present ConceptCombo, a video navigating interface facilitating user explorations of unstructured video collections with conceptual structures and themes of social comments extracted from videos and visualized by the system. To help novices identify a series of quality videos to watch, ConceptCombo aims to deliver a structured overview of the video collection by systematically extracting a concept map from the video content, coupled with automatic summarization of user comments across the videos, as a treemap visualization.

In supporting this publication, I contributed by writing front-end code to support user interview sessions, independently conducting interview sessions, and developing and coding interview scripts.
